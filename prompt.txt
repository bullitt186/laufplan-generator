Create a python script:

THe purpose of the script is to convert a training plan for running from csv or excel to an ical calendar file.
Following, you find requirements which must be satisfied by the script.

The script generates an iCal file based on the csv or excel file and the user input.
The script reads a csv or excel file with the following columns: week (from 1 to max 100), day (from 1 to 7), training, details, heartrate (in percent), distance (in km)
If called without arguments, the user shall be able to provide the input as arguments.
When invoked, the script shall show the user a short explanation what the purpose of this script is and what the necessary arguments are.

The script asks the user to enter his maximum heart rate (in bpm).
The script asks the user to enter a start date (format: yyyy-mm-dd).
If the start date is not a monday, make the start date the next monday after the provided date.
Each line of the csv or excel file shall lead to one calendar entry.
The calendar entries shall be created according to the following rules:
The date of the calendar entry shall be calculated based on the date entered by the user + the week and day as an positive offset.
Week = 1 means the first week of the training plan. Day 1 means monday, day 7 means sunday.
The calendar entries shall be all day events. Make sure to use "DATE" in the iCal File instead of "dtstart" and"dtend".
The calendar entries shall have the title of the column training.
The calendar entry shall have the details of the column details.
The details shall include the heartrate (in percentage).
The details shall include the heartrate in bpm.
This is calculated by multiplying the heartrate in percentage with the heartrate in bpm entered by the user.
The details shall include the heartrate zone. 
The heart rate zones shall be calculated based on this table:
Zone	Intensity	Percentage of maximum heart rate
Zone 1	Very light	50–60%
Zone 2	Light	60–70%
Zone 3	Moderate	70–80%
Zone 4	Hard	80–90%
Zone 5  Maximum 90-100%
the details shall include the distance (in km) from the input file.
each of the details stated above shall be separated by a line break.
The finished iCal file shall be saved under a file name which includes the word “Laufplan” and the entered date.

The script shall be internationalized.
The script shall have a configurable option to provide a prefix for the titles of the calendar entries. By default, the prefix shall be "Running"

Consider best practices in terms of input validation, robustness and maintainability. Document the source code. Each function shall have a description block.
